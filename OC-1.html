      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        There are many ways to draw molecular structures, and each variation of representing molecules on paper has its particular advantages and disadvantages.
        The three most common types of molecular representation in general chemistry courses are lewis structures,
         condensed structures, and molecular formulas. All of these methods of representing molecular structures are
          still useful in organic chemistry, but organic chemists often prefer bond-line structures.
          In organic chemistry, it is often impractical to use any other method because they can be too time consuming for large organic molecules.
        </p>
<h2>How to Draw Bond-Line Structures</h2>
<img style="width:250px; height:50px;" src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/0/d/sM5p_8wcJVfLi1ul9Wr5Yjw/image?w=353&h=82&rev=35&ac=1&parent=1IPB9ZFxeWPlzPLRr3-JcvbX-xI5q-gCaqXnQQIAjvLU" alt="Bond-line structure">
<p>
Bond-line structures differ from lewis structures in that lone pairs and bonds are not usually drawn.
Bond-line structures are particularly useful for organic chemists because they help show large carbon chains and they are easy to draw.
 They are drawn in a zigzag pattern, with each vertex representing a carbon atom.
 Double bonds and triples bonds are represented with two or three lines respectively.
  Triple bonds are always drawn without a zigzag, which represents the actual geometry of the molecule.

  <img style="width:250px; height:75px;" src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/0/d/sr2nGgjaj3eQ0PPPbHWqFvA/image?w=346&h=179&rev=72&ac=1&parent=1IPB9ZFxeWPlzPLRr3-JcvbX-xI5q-gCaqXnQQIAjvLU" alt="Double and triple bond example">
  <p>
Double bonds and triples bonds are represented with two or three lines respectively.
Triple bonds are always drawn without a zigzag, which represents the actual geometry of the molecule.
Although it appears that the carbon atoms shown in the diagrams have unfulfilled octets,
 it is assumed that they are bonded with enough hydrogen atoms to fulfill their octet.

    <h2>Formal Charge and Lone Pairs</h2>
    <img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/0/d/siYjhkEy0yXst8HCd8vPRZQ/image?w=212&h=221&rev=81&ac=1&parent=1IPB9ZFxeWPlzPLRr3-JcvbX-xI5q-gCaqXnQQIAjvLU" alt="Formal charge diagram">
    <p>
      Oftentimes we want to represent a formal charge on a bond line structure.
       To do that, we simply write the charge next to the atom we want to have a formal charge.
       Even though lone pairs are not drawn in the bond-line structures, we can infer from the charge the lone pairs surrounding an atom.
       In the diagram above,
       the oxygen has a negative charge and it is bonded to one carbon atom.
       Therefore the oxygen atom must have three lone pairs to fill its valence shell.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">-Drawing Resonance Structures</h3>
      <img style="width:300px; height:100px;" src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/0/d/sTmP5X91k3LGxrfX2XRnW7A/image?w=346&h=129&rev=74&ac=1&parent=1IPB9ZFxeWPlzPLRr3-JcvbX-xI5q-gCaqXnQQIAjvLU" alt="Resonance Structure example">
      <p>
        Sometimes, electrons are not confined to one space on an atom, but instead they are delocalized.
        This means that the charge is spread out over a larger area, which adds to the total stability of the molecule.
        This is called resonance and it is represented by brackets and a double pointed arrow in between each resonance structure.
        Note that each structure is part of the same entity, and they are not flipping back and forth between each other. This is called a resonance hybrid.
        </p>
        <div class="clear"></div>
        <h3>-Curved arrows</h3>
        <p>
          Curved arrows are tools used to properly draw resonance structures.
          Although they do not technically show the movement of electrons in resonance structures,
          curved arrows can represent electron movement as we will see later.
          There are some rules that need to be followed when using curved arrows:
          </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Never go over an elements octet</li>
          <li>Never break single bonds</li>
          </ol>
          <img style="width:300px; height:100px; float:none;" src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/0/d/s4O1tfETlc3ziakL5rgG_aw/image?w=346&h=129&rev=20&ac=1&parent=1IPB9ZFxeWPlzPLRr3-JcvbX-xI5q-gCaqXnQQIAjvLU" alt="Resonance structure example">
          <p>
            Now that we know the ways to draw resonance structures,
             we can now discuss common patterns that can help us identify which molecules will have resonance.
              There are five main patterns to recognize:
            </p>
            <div class="clear"></div>
            <ol>
              <li>Lone pairs next to carbocations (C +)</li>
              <li>Allylic lone pairs</li>
              <li>Allylic carbocations</li>
              <li>Pi bonds between two atoms of different electronegativity</li>
              <li>Conjugated pi bonds in a ring</li>
              </ol>
